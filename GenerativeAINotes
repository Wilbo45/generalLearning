Introducing GenerativeAI - CHAP 1
-------------------------------

Where it fits in the paths of ai...

Generative AI              (Specialised)
Deep Learning
Machine learning
Artiificial intelligence   (Generalised)

AI - Broad spectrum of creating systems that perform tasks, showing human intelligences and the ability and being able to interact with the ecosystem.

ML - branch focus on creating algorithms and models that enable the systems to learn and improve over time with training.

DL - subbranch of deep models that are called neural networks and suitable fo computer vision and NLP.
Typically discrimitive models that make predictions and infer patterns in the data.

GEN AI - Uses neural network models to generate new content from images to natural language from music to video.

TEXT GENERATION
GPT-3, developed by OpenAI can be trained on large amounts of text data and the used to generate new, coherent and gramatically correct text in dif languages, as well as extracting relevant features.

IMAGE GENERATION

MUSIC GENERATION

VIDEO GEN

Timeline started with ELIZA in the 60s.
Variational autoencoders are about breaking the image or problem down. Latent space is used to think about the characteristics of the problem and map these latent variables to the original value and then use these to create a new picture.

Neural networks consist of a generator and a discrimintor working against each other in a zero sum game.
ADVERSERIAL TRAINING. generator trying to fool the discriminator and the discrimantor trying to call the fake.

Transformer part of BERT. - revoultionary in language generation allowing for parrellel processing while retaining mem about the context of the language.

OPEN AI AND CHATGPT CHAP 2
----------------------------

Log in to OPENAI from google account... not happy!!

OpenAI focused on deep reinforcement learning combining neural networks with Reinforcement learning.

JARGON and glossary
TOKENS: work fragments or segments used to process input. processed by API
PROMPT: piece of text given as an input.
CONTEXT: The words and sentances that come before the users prompt. Used to generate the most probable next word.
MODEL CONF: level of certainty in prediction and input

CODEX - generate code.

The parameters:
 - Temperature, controls the randomness of the models response. Lower more determinsitic.
 - Max length, repsonse.
 - Stop sequence,
 - Top probabilities, 
 - Freq penalty,
